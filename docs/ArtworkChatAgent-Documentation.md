2. Creates appropriate persona handler
3. Builds conversation history with system prompts
4. Optionally includes vision analysis for visual questions
5. Generates AI response using configured settings
6. Creates suggested follow-up questions
7. Saves conversation to memory (if enabled)
8. Returns comprehensive response with analytics

**Key Features**:

- Error handling with fallback responses
- Performance monitoring and logging
- Configurable AI model settings
- Vision integration for image analysis

#### `GenerateConversationStartersAsync(ArtworkData, ChatPersona, CancellationToken)`

**Purpose**: Creates engaging opening questions for new conversations

**Features**:

- Persona-specific question generation
- Artwork-contextual suggestions
- Fallback to curated defaults
- Async generation with error handling

#### `GenerateSuggestedQuestionsAsync(ArtworkData, string, ChatPersona, CancellationToken)`

**Purpose**: Creates contextual follow-up questions based on conversation flow

**Logic**:

- Analyzes conversation context and user's last message
- Generates persona-appropriate questions
- Parses and filters AI responses
- Provides curated fallbacks

#### `AnalyzeArtworkVisuallyAsync(ArtworkData, string?, CancellationToken)`

**Purpose**: Performs detailed visual analysis of artwork images

**Capabilities**:

- Describes visual elements, colors, patterns, textures
- Analyzes composition and artistic techniques
- Responds to specific visual questions
- Handles missing images gracefully

### Core Private Methods

#### `BuildChatHistory(ChatRequest, ArtworkData, IPersonaHandler)`

**Purpose**: Constructs complete conversation context for AI processing

**Components**:

- System prompt from persona handler
- Historical conversation messages
- Current user message with optional vision content

#### `AddUserMessageWithVision(ChatHistory, ChatRequest, ArtworkData)`

**Purpose**: Intelligently adds user messages with vision analysis when appropriate

**Vision Logic**:

- Detects visual analysis requests through keyword matching
- Checks for available artwork images
- Validates vision model capabilities
- Falls back to text-only when needed

#### `IsVisualAnalysisRequest(string)`

**Purpose**: Determines if user message contains visual analysis keywords

**Keywords Detected**:

- Visual: "see", "look", "color", "shape", "pattern", "design", "visual", "appearance"
- Descriptive: "texture", "carving", "details", "surface", "decoration", "style", "form"
- Compositional: "composition", "describe", "show", "appears", "seems", "looks like"

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration Structure

```csharp
public class AgentConfiguration
{
    public ChatSettings DefaultChatSettings { get; set; }
    public CacheSettings Cache { get; set; }
    public OpenAISettings OpenAI { get; set; }
    public LoggingSettings Logging { get; set; }
}
```

### Key Configuration Options

#### **Chat Settings**

- `MaxTokens`: Maximum response length
- `Temperature`: Response creativity (0.0-1.0)
- `TopP`: Response diversity control
- `ModelId`: Primary chat model identifier

#### **Vision Settings**

- `VisionModelId`: Model for image analysis (e.g., "gpt-4-vision-preview")
- Vision detection and fallback logic

## Usage Examples

### Basic Chat Interaction

```csharp
var request = new ChatRequest
{
    ArtworkId = "artwork-123",
    Persona = ChatPersona.Artwork,
    Message = "Tell me about yourself",
    ConversationHistory = new List<ChatMessage>(),
    IncludeVisualAnalysis = true
};

var response = await chatAgent.ChatAsync(request);
```

### Visual Analysis

```csharp
var analysis = await chatAgent.AnalyzeArtworkVisuallyAsync(
    artwork, 
    "What colors and patterns do you see in this piece?"
);
```

### Conversation Starters

```csharp
var starters = await chatAgent.GenerateConversationStartersAsync(
    artwork, 
    ChatPersona.Artist
);
```

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Error Categories

1. **Artwork Not Found**: Graceful handling of missing artwork data
2. **Vision Processing Errors**: Fallback to text-only responses
3. **AI Service Errors**: Error messages with preserved analytics
4. **Memory/Cache Errors**: Continued operation without persistence

### Logging & Diagnostics

- Comprehensive logging at key operation points
- Performance metrics and timing
- Error context preservation
- Debug information for troubleshooting

## Performance Considerations

- Caching of conversation history
- Lazy loading of artwork enrichment data
- Configurable token limits
- Efficient vision detection logic

### Monitoring Metrics

- Response times per operation
- Token usage tracking
- Vision analysis frequency
- Error rates and types

## Integration Points

### Required Interfaces

- `IArtworkChatAgent`: Main service interface
- `IPersonaFactory`: Persona creation logic
- `IArtworkDataProvider`: Artwork data access
- `IChatMemory`: Conversation persistence
- `IPersonaHandler`: Persona-specific behavior

### Dependency Injection Setup

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<Kernel>(kernelBuilder.Build());
services.AddScoped<IArtworkChatAgent, ArtworkChatAgent>();
services.AddScoped<IPersonaFactory, PersonaFactory>();
services.AddScoped<IArtworkDataProvider, ArtworkDataProvider>();
services.AddScoped<IChatMemory, ChatMemory>();
```

## Future Enhancements
