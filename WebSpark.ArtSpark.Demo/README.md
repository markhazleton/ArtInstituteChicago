# 🎨 WebSpark.ArtSpark

**Where Open Art Meets .NET Excellence**

WebSpark.ArtSpark is a modern, open-source ASP.NET Core application that beautifully merges the cultural richness of the [Art Institute of Chicago](https://api.artic.edu/docs/) with the architectural clarity of the WebSpark NuGet packages. It demonstrates how public data, art, and .NET development can intersect to create immersive, responsive, and resilient applications.
