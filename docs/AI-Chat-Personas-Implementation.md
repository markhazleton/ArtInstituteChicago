## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture

```csharp
// Main chat interface
public interface IArtworkChatAgent
{
    Task<ChatResponse> ChatAsync(ChatRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<List<string>> GenerateConversationStartersAsync(ArtworkData artwork, ChatPersona persona, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<List<string>> GenerateSuggestedQuestionsAsync(ArtworkData artwork, string lastMessage, ChatPersona persona, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<string> AnalyzeArtworkVisuallyAsync(ArtworkData artwork, string? specificQuestion = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

### Persona Factory Pattern

```csharp
public interface IPersonaFactory
{
    IPersonaHandler CreatePersona(ChatPersona persona, ArtworkData artwork);
}

public enum ChatPersona
{
    Artwork,    // The artwork itself speaking in first person
    Artist,     // The artist who created the work
    Curator,    // Museum curator perspective
    Historian   // Historical expert viewpoint
}
```

### Chat Request/Response Models

```csharp
public class ChatRequest
{
    public int ArtworkId { get; set; }
    public string Message { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public ChatPersona Persona { get; set; } = ChatPersona.Artwork;
    public List<ChatMessage> ConversationHistory { get; set; } = new();
    public bool IncludeVisualAnalysis { get; set; } = true;
    public ChatSettings? Settings { get; set; }
}

public class ChatResponse
{
    public string Response { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public bool Success { get; set; }
    public string? Error { get; set; }
    public List<string> SuggestedQuestions { get; set; } = new();
    public ChatAnalytics Analytics { get; set; } = new();
    public Dictionary<string, object> Metadata { get; set; } = new();
}
```
