               asp-route-itemSlug="@artwork.Slug"
               class="text-decoration-none text-dark">
                @artwork.CustomTitle
            </a>
        }
        else

               asp-route-itemSlug="@artwork.Slug"
               class="text-decoration-none text-dark">

            </a>
        }

        }
    }
</h6>
```

#### 3. CSS Styling Enhancements

Added hover effects to both views to indicate clickability:

```css
.card-title a {
    transition: color 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

.card-title a:hover {
    color: var(--bs-primary) !important;
    text-decoration: underline !important;
}
```

## SEO-Friendly URL Structure

### URL Patterns

- **Public Collections:** `/collection/{collectionSlug}/item/{itemSlug}`
- **User Collections:** `/my/collection/{collectionSlug}/item/{itemSlug}`

### Examples

- Public: `/collection/modern-art-masterpieces/item/starry-night-van-gogh`
- Personal: `/my/collection/my-favorites/item/mona-lisa-da-vinci`

## Key Features

### 1. Conditional Link Generation

- Only creates clickable links if the artwork has a valid slug
- Falls back to plain text display for items without slugs
- Preserves existing functionality for edge cases

### 2. Responsive Design

- Links maintain the existing visual design
- Hover effects provide clear user feedback
- Dark text color maintains readability
- No text decoration by default, underline on hover

### 3. SEO Benefits

- Uses existing slug-based URL structure
- Maintains search engine friendly URLs
- Leverages established routing system
- Preserves canonical URL structure

### 4. User Experience

- Titles are now directly clickable for navigation
- Hover effects indicate interactive elements
- Maintains existing "View Details" buttons as alternative
- Consistent behavior across public and personal collections

## Technical Implementation

### Existing Infrastructure Utilized

- **UrlHelper.CollectionItemUrl()** methods for URL generation
- **Slug properties** on EnrichedArtworkViewModel
- **Existing routing** for `/collection/{slug}/item/{slug}` patterns
- **ASP.NET Core tag helpers** for route generation

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback for items without slugs
- Maintains display even if URL generation fails
- Preserves existing error handling patterns

### Performance Considerations

- No additional database queries required
- Utilizes existing view model data
- Minimal CSS for hover effects
- Leverages browser caching for repeated views

## Testing Recommendations

### Functional Tests

1. **Navigation Testing**
   - Click artwork titles in public collections
   - Click artwork titles in personal collections
   - Verify navigation to correct detail pages
   - Test with custom titles vs. original titles

2. **SEO URL Verification**
   - Confirm URLs follow expected patterns
   - Verify slug-based navigation works
   - Test bookmark functionality
   - Check URL sharing capabilities

3. **Responsive Testing**
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Verify touch interaction works
   - Check hover effects on desktop
   - Ensure accessibility compliance

### Edge Cases

1. **Missing Slugs**
   - Artworks without slugs display as plain text
   - No broken links generated
   - Existing "View Details" buttons still work

2. **Long Titles**
   - Test with very long artwork titles
   - Verify text wrapping behavior
   - Check mobile display

3. **Special Characters**
   - Test titles with special characters
   - Verify URL encoding works correctly
   - Check international character support

## Benefits Achieved

### For Users

- **Improved Navigation:** Direct click access to artwork details
- **Better UX:** Clear visual cues for interactive elements
- **Faster Access:** Reduced clicks to reach detail pages

### For SEO

- **Consistent URLs:** Maintains existing SEO-friendly structure
- **Link Equity:** Strengthens internal linking structure
- **Crawlability:** Improves search engine discovery of detail pages

### For Developers

- **Maintainable Code:** Reuses existing infrastructure
- **Consistent Patterns:** Follows established URL conventions
- **Extensible Design:** Easy to add similar functionality elsewhere

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Analytics Integration:** Track click-through rates on titles vs. buttons
2. **Keyboard Navigation:** Add keyboard accessibility features
3. **Touch Gestures:** Enhanced mobile interaction patterns
4. **Preview Cards:** Hover/touch previews of artwork details

### Technical Considerations

1. **Caching Strategy:** Optimize for repeated collection views
2. **Progressive Loading:** Consider lazy loading for large collections
3. **A/B Testing:** Compare user engagement metrics
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Track page load times and interaction rates

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully transforms static artwork titles into interactive, SEO-friendly navigation elements while maintaining the existing design aesthetic and performance characteristics. The solution leverages the established URL structure and routing system, providing immediate value with minimal technical debt.

The feature enhances both user experience and SEO performance by creating more pathways for users to discover individual artworks while maintaining search engine friendly URL patterns that support the overall site architecture.
