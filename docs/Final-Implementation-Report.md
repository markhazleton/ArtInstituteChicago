## 🐛 Critical Issue RESOLVED

### ❌ **Previous Issue**: Nested Dropdown Problem

- **Problem**: Theme switcher was closing main navigation dropdown when clicked
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, frustrating theme selection

### ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

#### **1. HTML Structure Enhancement**

```html
<div class="px-3 py-1" data-bs-auto-close="false">
    <bootswatch-theme-switcher 
        dropdown-menu-class="dropdown-menu dropdown-theme-list position-static"
        data-bs-auto-close="false" />
</div>
```

#### **2. CSS Nested Dropdown Support**

```css
.dropdown-theme-list {
  position: static !important;
  max-height: 150px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

#### **3. JavaScript Event Management**

```javascript
function handleNestedDropdowns() {
    // Prevents parent dropdown closure
    // Maintains theme selection functionality
    // Uses event.stopPropagation() strategically
}
```

### ✅ **Result**

- **Theme selection works perfectly**
- **Main navigation stays open during theme changes**
- **Smooth user experience across all devices**
